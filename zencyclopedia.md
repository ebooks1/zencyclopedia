Introduction <introduction>
================================================================================
In my time on the Internet, I've come across several instructional websites that
are extremely straightforward in their presentation of material, and often
maintain a sense of humor and self-awareness throughout. These tutorials, while
usually isolated works, have proven invaluable to me.

Additionally, I've observed that for most topics there are few, if any, guides
that facilitate first-principles approaches to learning.

Finally, there is not, as far as I know, a comprehensive guide to learning just
about anything using freely available resources.

To that end, I present the Zencyclopedia, a categorized list of resources to
assist in the learning of any subject from first principles. The name is a
portmanteau of the Japanese word 全 (pronounced "zen"), meaning "all" or
"everything," and the English word "encyclopedia."

The versioning of this document is handled using Git.

I expect there to be an initial skew towards fields I am familiar with or
particularly interested in, but hopefully, with community effort, that bias can
be corrected.
